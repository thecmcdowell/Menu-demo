#Menu Demo app
A simple react native that allows a user to manage a dining menu

####Running this project:
This project was built with react native, ensure that you have development env setup ([see React Native Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup))

1. install dependencies
   `yarn` or `npm install`

2. run the app
   ` npx react-native run-ios`

####notes about for this project
This project is using jest for testing, redux for state managment, and react-navigation for navigation.

I am aware that the spec request mentioned allowing the user to edit the image via url, but I felt that a user editing an image with the photo library would be a more valid user experience.

Also, this app was not tested on android, so functionality may be limited on that platform.
